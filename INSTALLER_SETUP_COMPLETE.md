### 4. **Build Scripts**
- 🚀 `build_installer.ps1` - PowerShell script with multiple options
- 🖱️ `build_installer.bat` - Simple batch file for easy building

## 🚀 Quick Start - Building Your First Installer:

### Option 1: Simple Batch File
```cmd
# Double-click or run in Command Prompt:
build_installer.bat
```

### Option 2: PowerShell (More Options)
```powershell
# Build everything:
.\build_installer.ps1 -All

# Just MSIX:
.\build_installer.ps1 -MSIXOnly
```

## 📋 Before First Build:

1. **Create App Icons** (Important!)
   - Use the SVG file: `assets/icons/app_icon.svg`
   - Convert to PNG (256x256): `assets/icons/app_icon.png`
   - Convert to ICO: `assets/icons/app_icon.ico`
   - Use online converters: https://convertio.co/

2. **Update Publisher Info**
   - Edit `pubspec.yaml` → `msix_config` section
   - Change company name, app name, publisher details

3. **Test Build Environment**
   - Ensure Flutter is in PATH
   - Visual Studio with C++ workload installed
   - Windows SDK available

## 📁 Expected Output:

After successful build:
```
build/windows/x64/runner/Release/
├── tailor_shop.exe           # Standalone application
├── *.msix                    # MSIX installer package
└── data/                     # App resources

installer/Output/             # If using Inno Setup
└── TailorShopSetup.exe      # Traditional installer
```

## 🎯 Next Steps:

### For Development:
1. Test the build process
2. Create proper app icons
3. Customize installer settings
4. Test on different Windows versions

### For Production:
1. Get code signing certificate
2. Set up automatic builds (CI/CD)
3. Create update mechanism
4. Plan distribution strategy

## 🔧 Troubleshooting:

- **Build fails**: Run `flutter doctor` to check setup
- **Icon warnings**: Create PNG icon from SVG template  
- **MSIX fails**: Check Windows SDK installation
- **Inno Setup not found**: Install from https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php
