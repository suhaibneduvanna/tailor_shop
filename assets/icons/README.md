# App Icon Instructions

You'll need to create app icons for your installer. Here are the requirements:

## Required Icon Files:

1. **app_icon.png** (256x256 pixels) - For MSIX installer
2. **app_icon.ico** - For traditional Windows installer

## Creating Icons:

### Option 1: Online Tools
- Use online PNG to ICO converters
- Recommended size: 256x256 pixels
- Use your company logo or a tailor-themed icon

### Option 2: Professional Tools
- Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop
- GIMP (free)
- Canva (online)

## Icon Design Suggestions:
- Use a scissors, needle, or sewing machine icon
- Include your company colors
- Keep it simple and recognizable
- Ensure it looks good at small sizes (16x16, 32x32)

## Temporary Icon:
For now, you can use Windows default application icon or create a simple text-based icon until you design a proper one.

Place your icons in the assets/icons/ folder with these exact names:
- app_icon.png
- app_icon.ico
